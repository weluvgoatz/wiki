# List of Levels

This document serves as a list of levels that currently exist, and are proposed to exist in the game.

# Current Levels

SuperTux currently is limited to two worlds, with two more coming in the future. A fork in the road of a worldmap will have the levels displayed based on their path.

**Icy Island**

The following levels are part of the Icy Island. There are 27 gameplay levels, marked in bold, with 3 cutscenes, marked in italics. Cutscenes dependent on a level have their parent level's name prefixing them. Hidden levels are also marked accordingly, and the level before them is the one that has the secret path to them.
